        <P class="weird">We all have "weird" hobbies and likes, but these are my weird likings. And I thought if I were to make websites, at least one of them should be about my weirdness but also let it be a space for anyone else who wants to express their own weirdness. I am definetly against anyone who looks down on  others just because of their diversities, therefore there will not be any toleration for anyone like that here.It is a safe space here. Anyway, here are some of weird hobbies:</P>
    </section>
    <section id="my weird hobbies">
        <ul>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>READING:</strong>I like all sorts of books and though some may think reading is about serious all the time but I like to indulge in more than one genre.My favorites are <em>fantasy and sci-fi</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>WRITING:</strong>I know it is kinda cliche but I like to write especially when I am feeling strong emotions and it really helped me over the years as I was never one to express what I would be feeling.My favorite is <em>poetry</em> but even if I have written quite a bit but I do not like to show it often.</li>
      </ol>
      </ul>
      <p class="weird">Anyway back to being weird, I said something about writing Poetry,here are some of them just a glimpse of the recent ones:</p>

     <ul>
        <li><strong><em>NIGHTMARES TO REMEMBER:</em></strong><br>It was like a nightmare,<br>
Indeed like a horrible dream but one that leaves us with a lesson,<br>
One that should teach the world of today and tomorrow the consequences of the likes of “little boy” and “fat man”,<br>
One that should leave us all wanting to always find nonviolent ways to strive for peace,<br>
So, today as the world comes together to remember, let us also make a promise in memory of those who passed that their lives will not be in vain,<br>
Though nightmares are forgotten, but this is reality that should never be forgotten.<br>
Together for peace<br>

<li><strong><em>THE UNCENSORED LIFE:</em></strong><br>
I met an old man,<br>
The years had passed so fast and so did his youth,<br>
Grief and trauma being his best friends till he breathes his last,<br>
Having been robbed of his youth was not his concern but anger of how much he sacrificed to be happy in his last days,<br>
No grandchild, no child and no wife, only a shattering silence that makes him regret not dying in the wars he fought,<br>
Hope he had for a better future burned to ashes as he was wise enough to see another brewing which thankfully he would not be there to see as it would bring him further sorrow.<br>
</li>
  </ul>
<p class="weird">I know you probably see a recurring theme but I was never one to write about smushy stuff, I guess I am not cut out for such.Anyway there are other reasons why I write, it is more of an inspiration really, when I hear stories of what others passed through makes me think how I would feel if i were in their shoes. Here is one that inspired me:<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.poemsearcher.com%2Ftopic%2Fhiroshima&psig=AOvVaw15SwBEfbKCdgiHbjzQrgrV&ust=1598009165158000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCMDAxY_YqesCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAJ"target="_blank">Hiroshima Girl</a></p>
